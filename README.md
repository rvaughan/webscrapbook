*Web ScrapBook* is a browser addon that captures the web page faithfully with various archive formats and customizable configurations.

A wab page can be saved as a folder, a single HTML file, a scripted single HTML file, or a zip-packed archive file (HTZ or MAFF). An archive file can be viewed via the built-in archive page viewer, or by opening the entry page after unzipping.

Besides, a site indexer is also built in and can be used to generate a static site of the captured web pages.

This extension is available for Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.), and Firefox for Desktop and Android.
